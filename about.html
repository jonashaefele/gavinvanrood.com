    <div id="ajax-detail">


      <p>Born and based in London, with qualifications in Graphic Design and Interior Design I loosely describe myself as a Conceptual Creative, working with branding agencies, marketing teams and individual clients to provide design concepts, strategy, management and roll-out.</p>
      <p>Influenced by architecture, construction, textiles and anthropology, I believe good design solutions come from persistence, planning, teamwork and encouragement.</p>

      <p>Throughout my career I’ve adapted and evolved my skillsets, allowing for a fluid transition between a variety of disciplines including: <h4>Graphic Design & Branding, Art Direction and Interior Design.</h4></p>

<p><h2>Graphic Design & Branding</h2></p>
<p><h3>With a degree in graphic design, I’ve worked across multiple sectors producing work that includes logo design, illustration, typography, print ads, point-of-sale, brochure layout & design, social media ads, commercial signage and internal way-finding.<h3></p>

<p><h2>Art Direction</h2></p>
<p><h3>Working in a classic Art-director / Copywriter duo team, I’ve helped to produce numerous pitch proposals, ad campaigns, refine brand’s tone of voice and created brand guidelines - leading creative direction and assuming brand guardian responsibility with an enthusiastic hands-on approach. Making good use of my background in graphic design, I create clean & considered presentation docs, PSD visualisations and digital mock-ups.<h3></p>

<p><h2>Photoshoot Art Direction</h2></p>
<p><h3>Taking my creative skills into the physical world and public spaces, I’ve worked on shoots for corporate branding, fashion styling and most recently the leisure hotel market as part of a wider branding campaign, creating a consistent look for over 300 unique properties. From sourcing props to dressing rooms and partnering with photographers, I’ve always enjoyed being hands on, and on-location.<h3></p>

<p><h2>Interior Design</h2></p>
<p><h3>Following recent studies in interior design, I’ve taken my domestic practice of this field into the commercial sphere, leading the creative direction in collaboration with Conran Interiors, for a suite of rental apartments in London’s Old St. Combining my skills in technical & perspective drawing with a love for patterns, textures, space zoning and furniture sourcing, I create creative solutions from colour scheme concepts to accurate plans and 3D renders.<h3></p>
