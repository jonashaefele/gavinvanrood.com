                          <br />

          <p>I played a central role in creating and rolling out a new brand identity for Taylor Wessing LLP, an international law firm. As part of an in-house design team appointed specifically for this project, I produced a modern design aesthetic featuring geometric forms, bold colours and landscape photography, taking inspiration from organic patterns found within nature.</p>

          <p>Outputs included BTL advertising, B2B comms and brochures, sector specific iconography, PPT pitch templates, new photographic suites and international office re-branding.</p>

          <p>Due to the pandemic, launch plans were shelved, and a micro-site was produced to celebrate the new brand, and function as a central resource for templates and assets. </p>

                            <p>To that end, I refined the existing set of brand assets to produce a series of presentation decks, event invitations and location exterior signage, defining typeface hierarchies, introducing new iconography and photography, and creating a new Brand Book to house the brand refresh.

                Tayma is known for it’s shared, yet unique historical and archaeological importance, and is referenced in countless historical records for it’s trade, royalty and cultural influences. The smallest of three neighbouring ancient towns, Tayms's primary focal point is the a functioning water-well housed within a unique asymmetrical shape.

                <p>
                    Working with a small collaborative creative team, this shape formed the basis of a wider pitch campaign,  functioning as a brand lock-up and window device highlighting leisure photography, unique location details and rich topographic textures.

                <p>
                  Muted tones synonymous with Tayma’s aesthetic contrast with strong location imagery and bold typography, while a unique dual-language logo was produced with the assistance of an illustrator specialising in Arabic typography.

                <br />

                <p>
                  Born from a small team of creative writers and television concept creators, working for the esteemed and well established Objective Media Group (OMG), Cultivate was set up to operate as a uniquely independent enterprise. </p>

          <p>Functioning within OMG, and seeking a unique brand identity to differentiate their business strategy and creative concepts, I worked closely with their founder, director and lead writer to create a very personal logo and brand identity with longevity and flexibility for mixed media usage, end-cards and other unforeseen applications.</p>

          <p>Landing on a strong and clearly legible typographic logo, the simple ‘slit’ generated a playful and creative edge, allowing for multiple iterations and creative applications.A warm and confident colour palette, numerous vintage TV sets, and a suite of playful textures were selected, allowing for variations across multiple platforms and production themes, while the X device was created as a reference to collaboration, to be used as a stand alone brand element, or in conjunction with the main logo.

                    foundation’s benefits to its Fairtrade farmers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By intelligent and creative use of logo, messaging and tone of
                  voice, we illustrated the parallels between the growth of coffee
                  plants and the beneficiaries. Specific location photography was
                  selected to illustrate the positive impact on farmers’ communities –
                  such as young people learning – made possible by public donations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The campaign was seamlessly refreshed and updated; ensuring
                  continued funding for the foundation’s work. The new messaging
                  improved transparency and helped to highlight the foundation’s
                  positive impacts. The indirect impact is a sustained positive boost
                  to the Costa brand.

          <p>
              Create a nation-branding proposal with new brand suite for all government
              departments.
          </p>

          <p>
            We proceed an adaptable brand identity to be applied across all
            government departments and agencies - including tourism, finance,
            education and maritime - while simultaneously safeguarding the
            nation’s brand identity to revive in it a proud sense of statehood,
            with a unified clear, and contemporary identity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our campaign won the Grand Prix Overall Winner at the Drum Marketing
            Awards 2014, and in May 2013 51 nations voted ‘Yes’ to grant
            Gibraltar EUFA membership.

            I was commissioned by Cuckooz Apartments to lead the interior design
            of their newest and largest property, as part of a collaboration
            with well established procurement specialists Conran Interiors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Retaining their playful & youthful brand aesthetic I created a
            sophisticated theme including unique mid-century pieces and high
            quality accent coloured furniture, to balance with the existing
            neutral marble interiors and white washed walls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Launching in early 2019, this landmark property’s interior has bene
            widely praised, thus creating desirable homes for their target
            market.

                      <p><i>Sydney based senior stylist and salon owner</i></p>

                      <br />

                      <p>
                  Create a fresh and distinct brand identity, with adaptable scope
                  for future business development and advertising.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Preempting the imminent launch of his first salon, Paul wanted to
                        retain his client base and discreetly soft-launch his new venture.
                        Capitalising on his award-wining career at Tony & Guy, I carefully
                        selected an image that reflected his success, with a hint of glamour
                        and femininity - literally flowing through his name. The ‘locks of
                        hair’ worked as an obvious nod to hairdressing, eliminating the need
                        to state the obvious, and allow his name to become the brand.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The format allowed for multiple, unknown future applications, and
                        Paul continues to use the original hero piece across all promotional
                        materials.

                    <p><i>LGBTQ+ club promoters and event organisers</p></i>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                      Part of East London's underground scene since 2009, these club promoters have established Sink The Pink as key players in the modern queer movement, organising and managing festivals (Mighty Hoopla), club nights and events, collaborating with the likes of Sony PlayStation, YSL and Stoli Vodka.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I was briefed to create a fresh and recognisable logo to feature on promotional
                          materials, stage sets and merchandise, reflecting a self
                          proclaimed style as vibrant, trashy, fun, frivolous and
                          unapologetic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Relying heavily on colourful neon characters
                      synonymous with night clubs and a street level aesthetic,
                      I created a logo that sucessfully reflects the diversity of the promoters and celebrates the club scene.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Unique and eclectic, the logo has adapted well to large-scale applications for events and
                      performances such as The Mighty Hoopla, London's Troxy, Bestival, Glastonbury and Selfridges.

                    <p>Capitalising on these inherited design attributes, and with the help of some well considered architectural modifications, Hotel Viajó must take influence from this celebrated period of interior design to create a sense of modernity, progression, comfort and serenity.</p>
                    <p>Delicately placing Hotel Viajó into the 21st century, a mixed use of original and modern pieces is encouraged, and hidden technology must work seamlessly with atypical materials, textures, lighting, furniture and layout.</p>
                    <p>The target audience of 35-50 year will have exposure to the abundant luxury available in 2018, expecting the highest quality design and finishes, whilst taking pleasure in the element of surprise and joy.</p>

                                <p>The interior must maximise the limited space, natural light, balcony access & views, by creating practical zones, comfortable spaces to relax, read, cook and sleep, with uncluttered ample storage space, practical surfaces. </p>

                                <p>Respecting the humble 1970’s planning, design and architecture, the kitchen and bathroom should have functional fixtures and fittings, be as spacious as possible, while minimising impact on the overall layout.

                Facing an urgent and rapid turnaround, a new website was required to display a large collection of projects, in preparation for a post-lockdown business strategy and brand launch.

                <p>
                With a brief to ensure the photography to take centerstage, I created a carousel for the landing page, a structured grid throughout, and project pages that adopted a more unique mood-board style layout. Allowing users to easily navigate the site and be enticed by the projects, short paragraph descriptions with an editorial serif typeface gave weight to the high profile client base. Whereas each

                The confident yet discreet new logo was knocked back, bringing the imagery to the forefront, and an alternative monogram logo was created to function as a stamp, for social media, or was a watermark.

                <p>
                This brief gave me the opportunity to learn new online website design tools, of which I am now fully competent.

                <p>
                  I delivered a creative direction to give the building a contemporary
                  iconic identity, and create a website that would cement the building
                  as a key destination for young professional renters. A lifestyle and
                  location photoshoot captured the aspirations of high rise living,
                  capitalising on the impressive City views and modern interiors.
                  Prior to launch, temporary on-site promotional hoardings helped to
                  ramp up enquiries, while permanent signage was prepared for
                  installation.

          <p>
      Boutique fashion brand, Meli Melo required help to refine their customer-facing visual personality, streamline their internal comms, and develop long-term creative concepts.
          </p>

          <p>
            I produced a new quarterly magazine, social posts, new product packaging, multiple brochures, seasonal look-books, and brand guidelines. Internal collateral included new briefing structures, sign-off processes, digital
            template suites, and photoshoot guidelines.
          </p>

          <p>
            These measures improved internal communication, freeing up more time for design time
            spent on design. Long-term campaigns flourished, with increased
            e-commerce activity running smoothly. Seasonal changes became
            slicker, social media language was modernised and brand consistency
            improved.

          <p>Create a brand identity, marketing comms and an online presence
              to launch a business and secure new clients.</p>

          <p>
            To promote my client as professional, established and qualified, the
            creative direction focused on strength and agility by incorporating
            an iconic Centurion’s helmet as the brand mark, thus creating a
            memorable link to the client’s name.Considering the target audience,
            an one page website was produced as a platform to promote the
            clients’ extensive qualifications and client testimonials, showcase
            location photography, and feature training videos.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resulting brand presence and promotions generated a marked
            increase in Roman’s client base, enabling more social working hours
            and the introduction of group training programmes.
