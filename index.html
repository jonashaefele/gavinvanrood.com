      <h3>Various clients</h3>
      <p>This page documents a selection of freelance work produced from 2020 to present day.</p>

        <p>The nature of freelance design has increased my adaptability, flexibility and knowledge base, working for a variety of agencies from 3 day to 3 month placements with some amazing talent across London and beyond. Whether working independently to develop brand identities from concept to launch, working with established brand guidelines for quick turnaround on-brand deliverables, or creative collaborations varying length and size, I've helped to produce brand identities, campaign concepts and pitch presentations.</p>

        <p>As a result some of the work displayed here is collaborative, some are creative artwork projects, and others are purely my own.</p>

          <p>I played a central role in creating and rolling out a new brand identity for Taylor Wessing LLP, an international law firm. As part of an in-house design team appointed specifically for this project, I produced a modern design aesthetic featuring geometric forms, bold colours and landscape photography, taking inspiration from organic patterns found within nature.</p>

          <p>Outputs included BTL advertising, B2B comms and brochures, sector specific iconography, PPT pitch templates, new photographic suites and international office re-branding.</p>

          <p>Due to the pandemic, launch plans were shelved, and a micro-site was produced to celebrate the new brand, and function as a central resource for templates and assets. </p>

                <p>
                        Tayma is known for it’s shared, yet unique historical and archaeological importance, and is referenced in countless historical records for it’s trade, royalty and cultural influences. The smallest of three neighbouring ancient towns, Tayms's primary focal point is the a functioning water-well housed within a unique asymmetrical shape.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working with a small collaborative creative team, this shape formed the basis of a wider pitch campaign,  functioning as a brand lock-up and window device highlighting leisure photography, unique location details and rich topographic textures.

                <p>
                  Muted tones synonymous with Tayma’s aesthetic contrast with strong location imagery and bold typography, while a unique dual-language logo was produced with the assistance of an illustrator specialising in Arabic typography.

                <br />

                <p>
                  Born from a small team of creative writers and television concept creators, working for the esteemed and well established Objective Media Group (OMG), Cultivate was set up to operate as a uniquely independent enterprise. </p>

          <p>Functioning within OMG, and seeking a unique brand identity to differentiate their business strategy and creative concepts, I worked closely with their founder, director and lead writer to create a very personal logo and brand identity with longevity and flexibility for mixed media usage, end-cards and other unforeseen applications.</p>

          <p>Landing on a strong and clearly legible typographic logo, the simple ‘slit’ generated a playful and creative edge, allowing for multiple iterations and creative applications.A warm and confident colour palette, numerous vintage TV sets, and a suite of playful textures were selected, allowing for variations across multiple platforms and production themes, while the X device was created as a reference to collaboration, to be used as a stand alone brand element, or in conjunction with the main logo.

              Update existing customer-facing materials and staff education
                    packs, creating a new value-embodying logo and communicating the
                    foundation’s benefits to its Fairtrade farmers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By intelligent and creative use of logo, messaging and tone of
                  voice, we illustrated the parallels between the growth of coffee
                  plants and the beneficiaries. Specific location photography was
                  selected to illustrate the positive impact on farmers’ communities –
                  such as young people learning – made possible by public donations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The campaign was seamlessly refreshed and updated; ensuring
                  continued funding for the foundation’s work. The new messaging
                  improved transparency and helped to highlight the foundation’s
                  positive impacts. The indirect impact is a sustained positive boost
                  to the Costa brand.

          Produce a colour scheme and source furniture for 12 rental

          <p>
            I was commissioned by Cuckooz Apartments to lead the interior design
            of their newest and largest property, as part of a collaboration
            with well established procurement specialists Conran Interiors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Retaining their playful & youthful brand aesthetic I created a
            sophisticated theme including unique mid-century pieces and high
            quality accent coloured furniture, to balance with the existing
            neutral marble interiors and white washed walls.
          </p>

          <p>
            Launching in early 2019, this landmark property’s interior has bene
            widely praised, thus creating desirable homes for their target
            market.

                    <br />

          <p>Capitalising on these inherited design attributes, and with the help of some well considered architectural modifications, Hotel Viajó must take influence from this celebrated period of interior design to create a sense of modernity, progression, comfort and serenity.</p>
          <p>Delicately placing Hotel Viajó into the 21st century, a mixed use of original and modern pieces is encouraged, and hidden technology must work seamlessly with atypical materials, textures, lighting, furniture and layout.</p>
          <p>The target audience of 35-50 year will have exposure to the abundant luxury available in 2018, expecting the highest quality design and finishes, whilst taking pleasure in the element of surprise and joy.</p>

              <p> My client's well connected London studio apartment meets his residential and commercial requirements, functioning as a calm sanctuary and a conveniently located home studio. </p>

                      <p>A collector of unique artefacts and personal items, and an eclectic wardrobe (catering for hikes, conferences, leisure and work), David requires adaptable and functional storage space to display or store these objects, avoiding a ‘clinical gallery space’ atmosphere.</p>

                      <p>The interior must maximise the limited space, natural light, balcony access & views, by creating practical zones, comfortable spaces to relax, read, cook and sleep, with uncluttered ample storage space, practical surfaces. </p>

                      <p>Respecting the humble 1970’s planning, design and architecture, the kitchen and bathroom should have functional fixtures and fittings, be as spacious as possible, while minimising impact on the overall layout.

                      <h3>Brand identity</h3>
                      <p><i>Sydney based senior stylist and salon owner</i></p>

                      <br />

                      <p>
                  Create a fresh and distinct brand identity, with adaptable scope
                  for future business development and advertising.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Preempting the imminent launch of his first salon, Paul wanted to
                        retain his client base and discreetly soft-launch his new venture.
                        Capitalising on his award-wining career at Tony & Guy, I carefully
                        selected an image that reflected his success, with a hint of glamour
                        and femininity - literally flowing through his name. The ‘locks of
                        hair’ worked as an obvious nod to hairdressing, eliminating the need
                        to state the obvious, and allow his name to become the brand.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The format allowed for multiple, unknown future applications, and
                        Paul continues to use the original hero piece across all promotional
                        materials.

                    <p><i>LGBTQ+ club promoters and event organisers</p></i>

                    <br />

                    <p>
                      Part of East London's underground scene since 2009, these well
                      established club promoters have managed their own bespoke festivals, club nights and events, and
                      collaborated with the likes of Sony PlayStation, YSL and Stoli Vodka.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I was briefed to create a fresh and recognisable logo to feature on promotional
                          materials, stage sets and merchandise, reflecting a self
                          proclaimed style as vibrant, trashy, fun, frivolous and
                          unapologetic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Relying heavily on colourful neon characters
                      synonymous with night clubs and a street level aesthetic,
                      I created a logo that sucessfully reflects the diversity of the promoters and celebrates the club scene.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Unique and eclectic, the logo has adapted well to large-scale applications for events and
                      performances such as The Mighty Hoopla, London's Troxy, Bestival, Glastonbury and Selfridges.

                              As part of a 'new concept team', I was tasked with 2 projects
                                that required an off-brand approach to create a stronger output;
                                Focus - the global annual leadership gathering; and new corporate
                                'gifts' designed to celebrate the DHL core values.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              For Focus, a proposed new strap-line 'The Power of Change' gave
                              depth to the event's directive, and the introduction of new graphic
                              devices provided creative flexibility, while high quality engaged
                              staff photography, and subtle nods to the DHL colour palette ensured
                              brand continuity.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              For corporate 'gifts' I sourced a range of products under €100 each
                              that subliminally linked to one or more of the established core
                              values. To not detract form the product's financial and intrinsic
                              value, no branding was applied to the products, and a range of
                              bespoke packaging solutions were proposed featuring a subtle twist
                              to the DHL brand.

                <p>
                Facing an urgent and rapid turnaround, a new website was required to display a large collection of projects, in preparation for a post-lockdown business strategy and brand launch.

                <p>
                With a brief to ensure the photography to take centerstage, I created a carousel for the landing page, a structured grid throughout, and project pages that adopted a more unique mood-board style layout. Allowing users to easily navigate the site and be enticed by the projects, short paragraph descriptions with an editorial serif typeface gave weight to the high profile client base. Whereas each

                The confident yet discreet new logo was knocked back, bringing the imagery to the forefront, and an alternative monogram logo was created to function as a stamp, for social media, or was a watermark.
                </p>

                <p>
                This brief gave me the opportunity to learn new online website design tools, of which I am now fully competent.

                <p>Launch the building into the lettings market, and drive high

                <p>
                  I delivered a creative direction to give the building a contemporary
                  iconic identity, and create a website that would cement the building
                  as a key destination for young professional renters. A lifestyle and
                  location photoshoot captured the aspirations of high rise living,
                  capitalising on the impressive City views and modern interiors.
                  Prior to launch, temporary on-site promotional hoardings helped to
                  ramp up enquiries, while permanent signage was prepared for
                  installation.

                  The design concept and photography were rolled out across multiple
                  integrated campaigns, social and onsite promotional materials, plus
                  a highly visual and responsive website was produced.

                <p>
                  Opting to design outside of the Hilton brand guidelines, I proposed
                  a visual timeline of key events throughout the period, and editorial
                  style features celebrating prominent moments in the hotel's history.
                  Extensive research into historical archives - coupled with site
                  visits, interviews, and photography - created a rich source of
                  content, which I curated into a high quality book that respectfully
                  reflected the hotel’s historical importance and outstanding
                  architecture.

                <p>
                  Available for purchase in the hotel lobby, the book was extremely
                  well received, and produced with foil-block detail and embossed
                  hardback cover.

          <p>
            I produced a new quarterly magazine, social posts, new product packaging, multiple brochures, seasonal look-books, and brand guidelines. Internal collateral included new briefing structures, sign-off processes, digital
            template suites, and photoshoot guidelines.
          </p>

          <p>
            These measures improved internal communication, freeing up more time for design time
            spent on design. Long-term campaigns flourished, with increased
            e-commerce activity running smoothly. Seasonal changes became
            slicker, social media language was modernised and brand consistency
            improved.

          <p>Design a distinct logo and brand direction to be used in

          <p>
            Citing Saint Edmund as the King of East Anglia in the 9th century
            and the first Patron Saint of England, I proposed a series of logo
            options with neutral nods to the past, delicately avoiding regal
            connotations. Adopting the traditional wax seal process to create a
            strong motif with contemporary applications and colour palettes, the
            heritage contrasts naturally with the clean design.
          </p>

          <p>
            Well received, the firm's launch and design proposals are on hold
            until investment is finalised.

          <p>
            To promote my client as professional, established and qualified, the
            creative direction focused on strength and agility by incorporating
            an iconic Centurion’s helmet as the brand mark, thus creating a
            memorable link to the client’s name.Considering the target audience,
            an one page website was produced as a platform to promote the
            clients’ extensive qualifications and client testimonials, showcase
            location photography, and feature training videos.

            The resulting brand presence and promotions generated a marked
