      <p>The Costa Foundation is an independent charity helping alleviate poverty in their affiliated coffee-growing countries. </p>

      <p>We were tasked with updating existing customer-facing materials and staff education packs, creating a new value-embodying logo and communicating the foundation’s benefits to its Fairtrade farmers.</p>

      <p>By intelligent and creative use of logo, messaging and tone of voice, we illustrated the parallels between the growth of coffee plants and the beneficiaries. Specific location photography was selected to illustrate the positive impact on farmers’ communities – such as young people learning – made possible by public donations.</p>

      <p>The campaign was seamlessly refreshed and updated; ensuring continued funding for the foundation’s work. The new messaging improved transparency and helped to highlight the foundation’s positive impacts. The indirect impact is a sustained positive boost to the Costa brand.</p>

      <p>FoodCycle is a UK based non-profit organisation that uses surplus food, kitchen space and volunteers to alleviate food poverty.</p>

      <p>Our task was to design and build a flexible website, update existing branding, increase awareness of core objectives and ultimately contribute to attracting more funds.</p>

      <p>I refined the colour palette and graphic assets, bringing clarity and a fresh look to their existing comms, and new promotional materials. In addition, a new website featuring an integrated donation section, social media links, and an adaptable WordPress structure, created an increase both in awareness and donations. </p>

      <p>The number of FoodCycle ‘hubs’ increased nationwide; funding was granted from government department Nesta. An endorsement of the programme by Alfred Prasad, of Tamarind in Mayfair, and a mention in Creative Review both helped to raise awareness – collectively attracting attention to the FoodCycle’s truly altruistic mission.</p>
