          <h3>Taylor Wessing</h3>
          <h3>Corporate rebrand</h3>

          <p><i>A global law firm with headquarters in London and Frankfurt</i></p>


                          <br />

          <p>Functioning as a small agency within the firm, the practical application of all deliverables - photography, graphics, internal comms and templates - became paramount, considering the myriad layers of sign-off synonymous with law firms.</p>

          <p>Our solution was based on the evolution of previously proposed line graphic patterns - taking influence from the work of Hartmut Böhm - drawing parallels between the organic and elegant patterns found within nature, and Taylor Wessing’s refined and logical working processes and reputation.</p>

          <p>Outputs included a range of bold line graphic devices and patterns, sector specific iconography, and photographic suites featuring geometric lines and patterns for generic usage, and close-up detail of relevant objects set against new brand colours for more specific subject matters. Both suites were designed to balance and contrast against a new clean typographic design and generous use of white space.</p>

          <p>With the unfortunate events surrounding Covid-19, our brand launch plans were completely revised, and I proposed a staff-access micro-site designed to educate and celebrate Taylor Wessing’s new brand direction remotely, allowing the website to tastefully lead as the sole new brand promotional tool. This was launched in May 2020.</p>

                  <i>TV production company</i>
                </p>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Born from a small team of creative writers and television concept creators, working for the esteemed and well established Object Media Group (OMG), Cultivate was set up to operate as a uniquely independent enterprise. </p>

          <p>Functioning within OMG, and seeking a unique brand identity to differentiate their business strategy and creative concepts, I worked closely with their founder, director and lead writer to create a very personal logo and brand identity with longevity and flexibility for mixed media usage, end-cards and other unforeseen applications.</p>

          <p>Landing on a strong and clearly legible typographic logo, the simple ‘slit’ generated a playful and creative edge, allowing for multiple iterations and creative applications.A warm and confident colour palette, numerous vintage TV sets, and a suite of playful textures were selected, allowing for variations across multiple platforms and production themes, while the X device was created as a reference to collaboration, to be used as a stand alone brand element, or in conjunction with the main logo.

              Update existing customer-facing materials and staff education
                    packs, creating a new value-embodying logo and communicating the
                    foundation’s benefits to its Fairtrade farmers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By intelligent and creative use of logo, messaging and tone of
                  voice, we illustrated the parallels between the growth of coffee
                  plants and the beneficiaries. Specific location photography was
                  selected to illustrate the positive impact on farmers’ communities –
                  such as young people learning – made possible by public donations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The campaign was seamlessly refreshed and updated; ensuring
                  continued funding for the foundation’s work. The new messaging
                  improved transparency and helped to highlight the foundation’s
                  positive impacts. The indirect impact is a sustained positive boost
                  to the Costa brand.

            Understanding the typical profile of sales people, and identifying
            the need to motivate and energise them for the year ahead, we
            anchored our creative direction around optimism, overcoming

              Produce concepts for 2 branding projects; support and promote the
              Gibraltar Football Association’s bid for membership of UEFA;
              create a 'nation branding' proposal for all government
              departments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Recognising UEFA as 53 member organisation, we adopted a
            presumptuous campaign approach by labelling Gibraltar as 'Team 54',
            celebrating the nation's long standing enthusiasm for football, and
            unique rich cultural heritage.
          </p>

          <p>
            We proceed an adaptable brand identity to be applied across all
            government departments and agencies - including tourism, finance,
            education and maritime - while simultaneously safeguarding the
            nation’s brand identity to revive in it a proud sense of statehood,
            with a unified clear, and contemporary identity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our campaign won the Grand Prix Overall Winner at the Drum Marketing
            Awards 2014, and in May 2013 51 nations voted ‘Yes’ to grant
            Gibraltar EUFA membership.

                  populated with vibrant branding, the flexible WordPress template
                  featured an donation facility, social media links, enabling the

                        retain his client base and discreetly soft-launch his new venture.
                        Capitalising on his award-wining career at Tony & Guy, I carefully
                        selected an image that reflected his success, with a hint of glamour
                        and femininity - literally flowing through his name. The ‘locks of
                        hair’ worked as an obvious nod to hairdressing, eliminating the need
                        to state the obvious, and allow his name to become the brand.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        The format allowed for multiple, unknown future applications, and
                        Paul continues to use the original hero piece across all promotional
                        materials.

                With a brief to ensure the photography to take centerstage, I created a carousel for the landing page, a structured grid throughout, and project pages that adopted a more unique mood-board style layout. Allowing users to easily navigate the site and be enticed by the projects, short paragraph descriptions with an editorial serif typeface gave weight to the high profile client base. Whereas each

                <p><i>LGBTQ club promoters and event organisers</p></i>

                <br />

                <p>
                  Part of East London's underground scene since 2009, these well
                  established club promoters have nurtured and supported a growing
                  scene to include performances, club nights and international
                  collaborations.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I was briefed to create a fresh and recognisable logo to feature on promotional
                      materials, stage sets and merchandise, reflecting a self
                      proclaimed style as vibrant, trashy, fun, frivolous and
                      unapologetic.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The logo I produced relied heavily on colourful neon characters
                  synonymous with night clubs, with a street level aesthetic
                  reflecting the diversity of the promoters, the club scene and their
                  followers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The resulting uniqueness of the logo and its eclectic characters has
                  proved versatile, working well as a stand alone brand marker, whilst
                  allowing for animation in digital formats, and multiple on-stage
                  construction methods. The logo can be seen at large scale events and
                  performances such The Mioght Hoopla, London's Troxy, Bestival,
                  Glastonbury and Selfridges.

                <p>
                  As part of a 'new concept team', I was tasked with 2 projects
                    that required an off-brand approach to create a stronger output;
                    Focus - the global annual leadership gathering; and new corporate
                    'gifts' designed to celebrate the DHL core values.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For Focus, a proposed new strap-line 'The Power of Change' gave
                  depth to the event's directive, and the introduction of new graphic
                  devices provided creative flexibility, while high quality engaged
                  staff photography, and subtle nods to the DHL colour palette ensured
                  brand continuity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For corporate 'gifts' I sourced a range of products under €100 each
                  that subliminally linked to one or more of the established core
                  values. To not detract form the product's financial and intrinsic
                  value, no branding was applied to the products, and a range of
                  bespoke packaging solutions were proposed featuring a subtle twist
                  to the DHL brand.

                  I delivered a creative direction to give the building a contemporary
                  iconic identity, and create a website that would cement the building
                  as a key destination for young professional renters. A lifestyle and
                  location photoshoot captured the aspirations of high rise living,
                  capitalising on the impressive City views and modern interiors.
                  Prior to launch, temporary on-site promotional hoardings helped to
                  ramp up enquiries, while permanent signage was prepared for
                  installation.
                </p>

                  The design concept and photography were rolled out across multiple
                  integrated campaigns, social and onsite promotional materials, plus
                  a highly visual and responsive website was produced.

                <p>
                  Opting to design outside of the Hilton brand guidelines, I proposed
                  a visual timeline of key events throughout the period, and editorial
                  style features celebrating prominent moments in the hotel's history.
                  Extensive research into historical archives - coupled with site
                  visits, interviews, and photography - created a rich source of
                  content, which I curated into a high quality book that respectfully
                  reflected the hotel’s historical importance and outstanding
                  architecture.

          I was required to define and develop brand consistency,
              capitalising on strong London and Sicilian heritage across
              packaging, B2B literature, and a strong digital presence,
              retaining an enthusiastic following in the US and Asia.
          </p>

          <p>
            I created a new briefing structure, sign-off process and digital
            template suite, and an evolving Brand & Photoshoot Guidelines doc
            helped to create consistency.This new brand direction allowed me to
            create revised packaging, weekly digital promotions, and a quarterly
            fanzine magazine.

            These measures improved internal communication and increased time

            slicker, social media language was modernised and brand consistency
            improved.

            Citing Saint Edmund as the King of East Anglia in the 9th century

            options with neutral nods to the past, delicately avoiding regal
            connotations. Adopting the traditional wax seal process to create a
            strong motif with contemporary applications and colour palettes, the

            an iconic Centurion’s helmet as the brand mark, thus creating a
            memorable link to the client’s name.Considering the target audience,
            an one page website was produced as a platform to promote the
            clients’ extensive qualifications and client testimonials, showcase
            location photography, and feature training videos.
          </p>

          <p>
            The resulting brand presence and promotions generated a marked
            increase in Roman’s client base, enabling more social working hours
            and the introduction of group training programmes.
