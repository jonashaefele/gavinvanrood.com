      <h3>FoodCycle</h3>
      <h3>Brand refresh, website and animated movie</h3>

      <p>FoodCycle is a UK based non-profit organisation that uses surplus food, kitchen space and volunteers to alleviate food poverty.</p>

      <p>Our task was to design and build a flexible website, update existing branding, increase awareness of core objectives and ultimately contribute to attracting more funds.</p>

      <p>I refined the colour palette and graphic assets, bringing clarity and a fresh look to their existing comms, and new promotional materials. In addition, a new website featuring an integrated donation section, social media links, and an adaptable WordPress structure, created an increase both in awareness and donations. </p>

      <p>The number of FoodCycle ‘hubs’ increased nationwide; funding was granted from government department Nesta. An endorsement of the programme by Alfred Prasad, of Tamarind in Mayfair, and a mention in Creative Review both helped to raise awareness – collectively attracting attention to the FoodCycle’s truly altruistic mission.</p>
