      <p><i>Increase street level brand awareness and visibility, improve the guest experience through way-finding, and reflect the local neighbourhood.</i></p>

      <p>After conducting extensive research into each building’s heritage, architecture, and local area history, I created a unique emblem for each property, and proposed concepts for external and internal signage. Threading this content into bespoke typographic and illustrative wall murals, I curated the lobby spaces to enrich the guest experience and lift the interiors.</p>

      <p>A series of wall plaques, external signage and wayfinding signage was successfully rolled out across the property portfolio, inceasing brand awareness and cementing Native as part of the fabric of the community.</p>

      <p>Project management included site visits, conceptual designs, planning applications, supplier liaison, artwork production and installation supervision.</p>

        <p>As part of a wider rebrand project, the photography was primarily required for a new, rebranded, image led e-commerce website, designed to promote the eclectic nature of the portfolio, highlight the benefits, and increase bookings. </p>

        <p>Working within a limited budget and tight timescales, I sourced a series of versatile props for the entire shoot to replacing the previous somewhat sterile photography, and create lifestyle themes throughout.</p>

        <p>A balance of 5-6 images per apartment was struck to minimise load time, while highlighting the uniqueness of each property, and it’s facileness by capturing colours, materials, work spaces, large bedrooms, fully equipped kitchens & dining spaces.</p>

        <p>The campaign was seamlessly refreshed and updated; ensuring continued funding for the foundation’s work. The new messaging improved transparency and helped to highlight the foundation’s positive impacts. The indirect impact is a sustained positive boost to the Costa brand.</p>

          - coupled with site visits, interviews, and photography - created a rich source of content, which I curated into a high quality book that respectfully reflected the hotel’s historical importance and outstanding architecture.</p>

        <p>Available for purchase in the hotel lobby, the book was extremely well received, and produced with foil-block detail and embossed hardback cover.</p>

            <p>Recognising UEFA as 53 member organisation, we adopted a presumptuous campaign approach by labelling Gibraltar as 'Team 54', celebrating the nation's long standing enthusiasm for football, and unique rich cultural heritage.</p>

            <p>We proceed an adaptable brand identity to be applied across all government departments and agencies - including tourism, finance, education and maritime - while simultaneously safeguarding the nation’s brand identity to revive in it a proud sense of statehood, with a unified clear, and contemporary identity.</p>

            <p>Our campaign won the Grand Prix Overall Winner at the Drum Marketing Awards 2014, and in May 2013 51 nations voted ‘Yes’ to grant Gibraltar EUFA membership.</p>

           <p>After conducting extensive research into the local area, referencing content from archaeological reports and architects’ plans, I created a modern aesthetic identity with strong links to the listed building’s heritage, created branded guest 'goodie bags', and launched a new 'guest pantry' concept containing locally sourced products and groceries.</p>

            <p>Working alongside architects and interior designers, I curated communal spaces including the Guest Pantry and Lobby area, using materials and furnishings carefully selected to sympathetically blend with traditional and new architectural additions. </p>

            <p>The initial proposal was eventually replaced with a more modest branding exercise as part of a wider rebrand project, and Empire Warehouse became Native Bankside.</p>

            <p>The logo I produced relied heavily on colourful neon characters synonymous with night clubs, with a street level aesthetic reflecting the diversity of the promoters, the club scene and their followers.</p>

            <p>The resulting uniqueness of the logo and its eclectic characters has proved versatile, working well as a stand alone brand marker, whilst allowing for animation in digital formats, and multiple on-stage construction methods. The logo can be seen at large scale events and performances such The Mioght Hoopla, London's Troxy, Bestival, Glastonbury and Selfridges.</p>

        <h3>Branding, website and promotions</h3>

        <p>London based Personal Trainer and Sports Therapist.</p>

        <p><i>Create a brand identity, marketing comms and an online presence to launch a business and secure new clients.</i></p>

          <p>To promote my client as professional, established and qualified, the creative direction focused on strength and agility by incorporating an iconic Centurion’s helmet as the brand mark, thus creating a memorable link to the client’s name.Considering the target audience, an one page website was produced as a platform to promote the clients’ extensive qualifications and client testimonials, showcase location photography, and feature training videos.

          <p>The resulting brand presence and promotions generated a marked increase in Roman’s client base, enabling more social working hours and the introduction of group training programmes.</p>

        <h3>Pioneer Point</h3>

        <h3>Branding, art direction, website, signage and promotions</h3>

        <p>A newly opened landmark residential tower in East London, comprising of 296 rental apartments.</p>

        <p><i>Launch the building into the lettings market, and drive high levels of demand and awareness.</i></p>

        <p>I delivered a creative direction to give the building a contemporary iconic identity, and create a website that would cement the building as a key destination for young professional renters. A lifestyle and location photoshoot captured the aspirations
          of high rise living, capitalising on the impressive City views and modern interiors. Prior to launch, temporary on-site promotional hoardings helped to ramp up enquiries, while permanent signage was prepared for installation.</p>

        <p>The design concept and photography were rolled out across multiple integrated campaigns, social and onsite promotional materials, plus a highly visual and responsive website was produced.</p>

        <h3>DHL</h3>

        <h3>Corporate event creative and packaging solutions</h3>

        <p>The world's largest logistics and express delivery company.</p>

        <p><i>As part of a 'new concept team', I was tasked with 2 projects that required an off-brand approach to create a stronger output; Focus - the global annual leadership gathering; and new corporate 'gifts' designed to celebrate the DHL core values.</i></p>

        <p>For Focus, a proposed new strap-line 'The Power of Change' gave depth to the event's directive, and the introduction of new graphic devices provided creative flexibility, while high quality engaged staff photography, and subtle nods to the DHL
          colour palette ensured brand continuity.</p>

        <p>For corporate 'gifts' I sourced a range of products under €100 each that subliminally linked to one or more of the established core values. To not detract form the product's financial and intrinsic value, no branding was applied to the products, and a range of bespoke packaging solutions were proposed featuring a subtle twist to the DHL brand.</p>
